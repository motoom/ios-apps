import UIKit
class ViewController: UIViewController {
}

// todo: viewWillLayoutSubviews() for recalc of margins etc. instead of in Draw

// todo: statusBarOrientation() to determine the device orientation.

// At launch time, apps should always set up their interface in a portrait orientation. After the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method returns, the app uses the view controller rotation mechanism described above to rotate the views to the appropriate orientation prior to showing the window.
